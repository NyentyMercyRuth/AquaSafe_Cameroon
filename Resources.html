        <h1>What Is Marine Conservation?</h1>
        <P>Marine conservation, also known as ocean conservation, is the protection and preservation of ecosystems in oceans and seas through planned management in order to prevent the over-exploitation of these marine resources. Marine conservation is informed by the study of marine plants and animal resources and ecosystem functions and is driven by response to the manifested negative effects seen in the environment such as species loss, habitat degradation and changes in ecosystem functions[1] and focuses on limiting human-caused damage to marine ecosystems, restoring damaged marine ecosystems, and preserving vulnerable species and ecosystems of the marine life. Marine conservation is a relatively new discipline which has developed as a response to biological issues such as extinction and marine habitats change.</P>
           <p>Marine conservationists rely on a combination of scientific principles derived from marine biology, Ecology, oceanography, and fisheries science, as well as on human factors, such as demand for marine resources, maritime law, economics, and policy, in order to determine how to best protect and conserve marine species and ecosystems. Marine conservation may be described as a sub-discipline of conservation biology.</P>

        <h1>What Are Some Of The Challenges Faced In Ocean Conservation?</h1>
        <p>The ocean, the lifeblood of our planet, faces unprecedented threats from human activities. Climate change, pollution, overfishing, and coastal development are 
            projected to cause a significant loss of marine biodiversity, with over half of the world's marine species potentially facing extinction by 2100.
            These marine ecosystems face the following challenges:</p>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="challenges-col">
                <h3>Pollution and Waste</h3>
                <p>Pollution and waste pose significant threats to marine ecosystems. Plastic debris, toxic chemicals, and oil spills harm marine life and contaminate the food chain. 
                    Marine animals get entangled, suffocated, or ingest plastic waste, causing injury or death. Reducing plastic use and proper waste disposal can help mitigate these impacts.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="challenges-col">
                <h3>Overexploitation and Habitat Destruction</h3>
                <p>Overfishing and destructive fishing practices deplete fish populations and damage habitats. Coastal development, dredging, and mining destroy critical habitats like coral reefs
                    and mangroves. Overexploitation of marine resources threatens the livelihoods of communities dependent on fishing. Sustainable fishing practices and protected areas can help conserve marine biodiversity.             
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="challenges-col">
                <h3>Climate Change</h3>
                <p> Climate change affects marine ecosystems through ocean acidification, warming, and sea-level rise. Rising temperatures can cause coral bleaching, alter species distributions, 
                    and impact fisheries. Ocean acidification reduces the ability of shellfish to build shells, threatening their survival. Reducing green house gas emmisions can help mitigate the impact of climate change on marine ecosystems.

                    <h3>BIODIVERSITY AND ECOSYSTEMS</h3>
                    <p>The ocean harbors nearly 80% of eath's biodiversity beneath it's shimmering surface. Coral reefs, Kelp forests, and deep-sea trenches form complex ecosystems that Sustain
                        countless species, from microscopic plankton to massive blue whales. Protecting the ocean means preserving the delicate web of life that keeps our planet thriving.

                    <h3>REGULATION OF CLIMATE</h3>
                    <p>The ocean plays a crucial role in regulating Earth's climate by absorbing vast amounts of heat and carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Ocean currents distrubute this heat around the globe helping to stabilize temperatures and weather patterns. 
                        Phytoplankton in the ocean also acts like forests, capturing carbon and realesing oxygene through photosynthesis. The ocean's health is our climate's wealth.</p>

                    <p>Marine conservation ensures food security and livelihoods for millions. Oceans provide a rich source of food to support commercial fisheries.
                        Sustainable practices help maintain seafood supplies and support coastal communities. Effective conservation benefits both people and the planet.
