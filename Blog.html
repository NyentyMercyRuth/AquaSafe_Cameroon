                    <a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/africa/en/press/57770/turning-the-tide-cameroon-commits-to-ocean-protection/" class="blog-title">BBNJ Agreement Between Government And Internationals</a>
                    <p>Yaoundé, May 8, 2025 – Cameroon has taken a major step toward ocean protection by signing, on May 2, 2025, the Agreement on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ Agreement). This agreement aims to establish a global, legally binding framework for the preservation of biodiversity in the high seas.

                        The news comes just weeks before the United Nations Ocean Conference (UNOC), strengthening Cameroon’s position on the international stage in ocean governance. “The Cameroonian government’s signature is a glimmer of hope for the future of our oceans,” says Dr. Aliou Ba, Oceans Campaign Lead at Greenpeace Africa. “We now hope for swift ratification so that this commitment can become reality.”
                        
                        The signed agreement is part of a global movement to close the legal gap surrounding international marine areas. It establishes binding rules to protect species, regulate human activities on the high seas and enhance scientific cooperation.
                        
                        However, vigilance remains crucial at the national level. A recent Mongabay investigation, published in April 2025, revealed serious threats to the Manyange na Elombo Campo Marine Park —the first marine protected area in Cameroon. This site, located near Kribi, is currently under threat from a controversial iron mining project.
                        
                        “This example highlights the contradictions between political commitments and on-the-ground realities,” notes Dr. Ba. “The treaty’s signature alone is not enough. It must be followed by strong measures to protect coastal areas and marine resources.”
                        
                        With 500 kilometers of coastline along the Atlantic Ocean, Cameroon is home to remarkable marine biodiversity: over 500 fish species, marine mammals, and plankton-rich ecosystems. These vital resources are now under threat from industrial exploitation, pollution and the effects of climate change.
                        
                        Greenpeace Africa is urging Cameroonian authorities to turn this signature into concrete action: strengthening conservation mechanisms, monitoring marine activities and honoring international commitments.
                        
                        “We applaud Cameroon’s example and call on other African nations to follow suit. This treaty is a historic opportunity for Africa to play a leading role in ocean protection—for the benefit of communities, biodiversity, and future generations.” concludes Dr. Ba.

                    <p>Fishermen form the vital backbone of the SIREN Citizen Science app. Their contributions have unveiled a myriad of species, previously unknown to inhabit our waters. The ocean’s vastness is now within our grasp, thanks to the SIREN app. It allows us to explore marine life from the convenience of our mobile devices.

                        This remarkable achievement is made possible by a network of over 100 dedicated fishermen participating in this citizen science project. Among them is Mr. Alfred, an artisanal fisherman who has been collaborating with AMMCO for over eight years on the SIREN app. His unwavering commitment has shed light on the presence of various species along the coast of Limbe, enabling us to take significant conservation steps.
                        He has also played a pivotal role in encouraging his colleagues to join the SIREN Network. As we approach World Oceans Day, we acknowledge the influential role that coastal communities and fishermen play in conservation.
                        
                        Effective conservation requires a collective effort, and these local heroes continue to shape the course of conservation, challenging the status quo and amplifying the voices of their communities at every turn. We are more than pleased to accompany them on this journey, recognizing their invaluable contributions to marine conservation.

                    <p>The Cameroon Beach Cleanup is a pioneering environmental initiative led by the Association for Community Awareness (ASCOA). Established in 2022, this initiative reflects ASCOA’s enduring commitment to preserving Cameroon’s beaches and safeguarding the marine ecosystems dependent on these environments. The Cameroon Beach Cleanup has evolved into a national event, observed annually during the third week of January. This regular event underscores ASCOA’s dedication to addressing the escalating issue of marine debris and plastic pollution along the country’s coastlines.

                        Since its inception, the Cameroon Beach Cleanup has grown significantly, with ASCOA successfully organizing cleanups in all major coastal regions, including Limbe, Douala, and Kribi. These beach cleanups have become integral components of a broader strategy to monitor and maintain Cameroon’s coastlines continuously. ASCOA’s leadership in this area has mobilized thousands of passionate volunteers, dedicated to preserving the ocean and protecting their local environments. The cleanups have resulted in the removal of substantial quantities of plastic waste and marine debris, preventing harm to wildlife and ecosystems.
                        Since its inception in 2022, over 1200 tons of waste have been removed from the Cameroonian coastlines with thousands of volunteers mobilized across major coastal regions.
                        
                        On Saturday, January 25, YANA joined several sister organizations for the third edition of the Cameroon Beach Cleanup Day 2025 organized by the Association for Community Awareness (ASCOA) at the Limbe Down Beach, in the Southwest region of Cameroon.
                        The event saw a notable participation from over 600 volunteers representing different sister organizations, demonstrating a shared dedication to environmental stewardship.
                        During the event, over 10,000+ plastic waste and over 3 tonnes of sea shells were removed from the Limbe beach. Removing plastic waste from our coastlines helps decrease the amount of marine debris that enters the ocean, harming marine life and ecosystems, helps preserve habitats and protects endangered species that are affected by plastic pollution.
                        
                        Organized coastal cleanups like the Cameroon Beach Cleanup Day raises awareness about plastic pollution, promotes community engagement, and educates people about the importance of proper waste management.
                        
                        We want to specially appreciate ASCOA, her sponsors, other partner organizations and the volunteers who made this year’s event a success.

                    <p>By Aristide Takoukam Kamla, 12th September 2024
                        One of Cameroon’s leading marine conservationists is revolutionising marine conservation in Cameroon and Africa with a simple mobile application that empowers local communities to take the lead in conservation efforts.
                         
                        
                        In 2023, the Mobula hypostoma, otherwise known as the Atlantic pygmy devil ray, was spotted in a coastal community in Cameroon, thanks to a fisherman who used the Siren Application to document the observation—SIREN is a citizen science platform initiated by Dr Kamla Aristide, a prominent Cameroonian marine biologist and conservationist.
                        
                        The Siren App empowers local fishers to collect and record marine mammal sightings, capturing essential details such as date, time, GPS location, species name, habitat, behaviour, and weather conditions. Data is stored locally on their phones, uploaded to a server when internet connectivity is available, and displayed on an interactive web map for easy access.

                    <p>The carbonate system variability and acidification process remain little understood in the coastal ocean of Cameroon. The aim of this study was to assess the variability of the carbonate system in a portion of the southern coast of Cameroon, and the influence of local seawater physicochemical and biological properties on keys parameters of this system. The study was carried out at three fixed sampling stations (Bp, Kb, and Eb), from September 2021 to August 2022 involving all the seasons encountered in the study area. The carbonate system was determined from Total alkalinity (TA), pH, temperature and salinity, using the CO2SYS_xls program. In addition, nutrients (nitrate, nitrite, phosphate and nitrogen ammonia) and chlorophyll-a data were
                         collected simultaneously at each station. The results showed a high variability of the carbonate system parameters on both temporal and spatial scale. TA and bicarbonate ions (HCO3− ) were significantly different between the large rainy season (LRS) and small rainy season (SRS), while CO2 and CO2 partial pressure (pCO2) were significantly different between Kb and Eb sampling stations (p-value < 0.05). The critical thresholds for ocean acidification (OA) seems to not been reached in the southern coastal ocean of Cameroon, given the means values of pH (8.14 ± 0.17), aragonite (3.31 ± 1.3 Ω) and calcite (5.3 ± 2.05 Ω) saturation states obtained. Salinity appears as the main driver of the variability of TA in the study area, while, nitrogen ammonia and the dissolved carbon dioxide from the degradation of organic matter, respiration and atmospheric absorption, appears as the drivers of pH variation. The large rainy season (LRS) seems to be the most critical period for OA sensitive organisms, while the Bp station looks most vulnerable.

                    <p>In November 2022, Sia Partners, together with Orange and Planète Urgence, launched the CAMERR project (Cameroon Mangrove Ecosystem Restoration & Resilience).
                        Mangroves are disappearing. An estimated 25% of mangroves have been lost in the past 40 years, resulting from coastal development, land conversion for aquaculture and agriculture, overexploitation, 
                        and pollution. The societal implications of depleted mangrove ecosystems are vast: they include reduced economic growth, impoverished livelihoods, declining human security, poorer quality of life for local communities. and more carbon in the atmosphere.
